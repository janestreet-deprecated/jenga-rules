We no longer release this repository. It used to contain the internal
Jane Street build rules written for Jenga, a build system that was
developed at Jane Street.

If you were using Jenga and this repository in the past, you are
encouraged to switch to [dune](https://dune.build/) as we are planning
to switch to dune inside Jane Street and will no longer develop Jenga.
